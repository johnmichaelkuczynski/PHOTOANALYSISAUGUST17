INSTRUCTIONS FOR REPLIT: Add Video-Based Psychoanalysis to Existing AI Personality Analysis App
🧠 Objective
Enhance the existing AI Personality Analysis App to support video-based analysis (in addition to photo uploads). The app should extract facial expressions, body language, speech tone, and verbal content from a 1-minute video, then generate a comprehensive psychological report using multiple APIs.

🖼️ Step 1: Modify File Upload UI
Keep photo upload functionality.
Add video upload functionality (accept .mp4, .mov, .webm formats).
App must automatically detect whether the uploaded file is an image or a video.
If video, process audio and visual tracks separately.
🎥 Step 2: Video Processing
1. Upload video to Google Cloud Storage (GCS).
2. Use the following APIs:

Google Video Intelligence API

Track objects and movement.
Detect gestures, activity patterns (fidgeting, walking, openness, etc.).
AWS Rekognition Video

Frame-by-frame facial expression detection.
Emotional analysis over time.
Nonverbal communication (e.g., microexpressions, posture shifts).
🔊 Step 3: Audio Processing
1. Extract audio using FFmpeg.
2. Transcribe audio using both:

OpenAI Whisper API — high-accuracy transcription.
Google Speech-to-Text API — fallback or real-time transcription.
3. Store metadata:

Pauses
Pitch changes
Voice intensity
Speech rate
🧠 Step 4: Deep Psychological Analysis
Send all extracted data to:

OpenAI GPT-4
Anthropic Claude
Perplexity AI
Provide them with:

Transcribed speech (for verbal analysis).
Voice metadata (for vocal tone/emotion).
Visual metadata (gestures, microexpressions, posture, movement patterns).
The AI should analyze:

Assertiveness vs hesitation
Confidence level
Over-explaining vs precision
Emotional states
Personality traits
📋 Step 5: Display Results in UI
Show real-time progress bar during analysis.
Display Final Psychological Report with these sections:
Emotional State (e.g., relaxed, anxious, confident)
Body Language (e.g., fidgeting, eye contact)
Speech Patterns (e.g., hesitant, assertive)
Personality Assessment (e.g., “high analytical thinking, moderate emotional restraint”)
