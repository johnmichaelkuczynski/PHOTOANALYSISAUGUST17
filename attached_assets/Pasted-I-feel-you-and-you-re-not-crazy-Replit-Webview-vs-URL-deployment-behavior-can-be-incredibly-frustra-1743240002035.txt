I feel you—and you’re not crazy. Replit Webview vs URL deployment behavior can be incredibly frustrating, especially when you know your app works, but:

The Share button or URL doesn’t appear

Or the app runs only in Preview (Webview), not in a standalone browser window

Let’s fix this, once and for all.

🧠 What’s Really Going On
When you're running an app in Replit and the “Share” link or external URL isn't visible, it's because:

❌ The app is still running in Webview-only mode
This mode:

Runs your app in an embedded pane inside Replit

Does NOT expose a public URL

Is great for testing, but bad for actual deployment/sharing

✅ THE FIX: Run Your App on a Public Port (with Replit “Show in a new tab” enabled)
🔧 1. Add this to your main.py (if FastAPI):
python
Copy
Edit
import uvicorn

if __name__ == "__main__":
    uvicorn.run("main:app", host="0.0.0.0", port=8080, reload=True)
Make sure you're using port 8080 (Replit default), not 5000 or 3000.

🔧 2. In .replit, add or edit this:
ini
Copy
Edit
run = "python3 main.py"
Or, if you're using uvicorn directly from shell:

ini
Copy
Edit
run = "uvicorn main:app --host=0.0.0.0 --port=8080"
🔧 3. Click the ⚙️ (gear) icon near the “Run” button → enable:
✅ Show output in a new tab

This is critical. If this isn’t enabled, your app stays trapped in the Webview.

🔧 4. Stop and Re-Run the Replit
Once it’s running:

Replit will expose your public URL at the top

It should look like:

php-template
Copy
Edit
https://<your-repl-name>.<your-username>.repl.co
Now the “Share” button appears
→ And the app can be opened in a real browser
→ And you can distribute the link

✅ Optional: Add a “Copy Link” Button in Your App
If your frontend is custom (React, Streamlit, etc.), add:

html
Copy
Edit
<button onclick="navigator.clipboard.writeText(window.location.href)">Copy Link</button>
That way users can always grab the full public URL.

💥 TL;DR — Tell Replit This (Copy/Paste to Them)
Please stop running my app in Webview-only mode. I need it exposed at a real URL.

My app uses FastAPI and runs on port 8080. I’ve added uvicorn.run(... host='0.0.0.0', port=8080) and show = "new tab" is enabled. I want to share the public link.

Can you force deploy it to https://<repl-name>.<user>.repl.co, or fix whatever is blocking this?
