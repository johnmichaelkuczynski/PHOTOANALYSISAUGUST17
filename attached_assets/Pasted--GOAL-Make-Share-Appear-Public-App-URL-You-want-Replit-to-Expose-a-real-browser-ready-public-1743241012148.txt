 GOAL: Make “Share” Appear (Public App URL)
You want Replit to:

Expose a real, browser-ready public link like
https://your-app.username.repl.co

Not just run your app in the Webview panel

Not silently break every time you hit “Run”

🧰 THE ONLY THINGS THAT ACTUALLY WORK
Here is the definitive fix stack—follow this exactly:

✅ 1. Your App Must Run on Port 8080
Replit only exposes port 8080 to the public web. If your app listens on 5000, 3000, etc.—no URL will appear.

In main.py (or wherever your FastAPI app runs), make sure you have this:

python
Copy
Edit
if __name__ == "__main__":
    import uvicorn
    uvicorn.run("main:app", host="0.0.0.0", port=8080, reload=True)
✅ 2. Your .replit File Must Be Correct
Create or fix your .replit to read:

ini
Copy
Edit
run = "python3 main.py"
entrypoint = "main.py"
language = "python3"
✅ 3. You Must Set Output to "Open in a New Tab"
This is the single biggest cause of broken Share buttons.

Click the ⚙️ Settings icon (top right in Replit editor)

Scroll to “Show output in”

Select ✅ “New tab” (not "Webview")

Replit hides the Share link unless this is set.

✅ 4. Stop and Re-Run the App
After doing all of the above:

Hit “Stop”

Then hit “Run”

A new browser tab should open

At the top of that browser tab, you’ll now see:

arduino
Copy
Edit
https://your-app.username.repl.co
Copy that—that’s your Share link.

❌ If That Still Doesn’t Work...
Use this emergency script to print your public URL manually:

python
Copy
Edit
import os

repl_url = os.environ.get("REPL_SLUG") + "." + os.environ.get("REPL_OWNER") + ".repl.co"
print("Public URL: https://" + repl_url)
Paste this in a Python file and run it—you’ll get your public URL even if the UI hides it.

✅ TL;DR — TELL REPLIT THIS (Copy/Paste)
Please configure my app to:

Run on port 8080

Use uvicorn.run(..., port=8080)

Show output in New Tab, not Webview

Set .replit to run = "python3 main.py"

Expose the Share link visibly at https://<app>.<user>.repl.co

I've asked for this multiple times. Please stop running the app in Webview-only mode.

You're not asking for magic. You're asking Replit to do what it says it does.

Let me know if you want me to generate a working .replit file and main.py that guarantees the Share URL shows up. I’ll drop it right here.
