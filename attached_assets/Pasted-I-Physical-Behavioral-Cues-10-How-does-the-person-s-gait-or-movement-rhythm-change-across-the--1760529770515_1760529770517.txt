I. Physical & Behavioral Cues (10)

How does the person’s gait or movement rhythm change across the clip?

Which recurring gesture seems habitual rather than situational?

Describe one moment where muscle tension releases or spikes — what triggers it?

How does posture vary when the person speaks vs. listens?

Identify one micro-adjustment (e.g., hair touch, collar fix) and explain its likely emotional cause.

What is the person doing with their hands during silent intervals?

How consistent is eye-contact across frames? Give timestamps showing breaks or sustained gazes.

At which point does breathing rate visibly change, and what precedes it?

Describe the physical energy level throughout — rising, falling, or cyclical?

What body part seems most expressive (eyes, shoulders, mouth), and how is that used?

II. Expression & Emotion Over Time (10)

Track micro-expressions that flicker and vanish. At what timestamps do they appear?

When does the dominant emotion shift, and how abruptly?

Does the person’s smile fade naturally or snap off?

Which emotion seems performed vs. spontaneous? Cite frames.

How does blink rate change when discussing specific topics?

Identify one involuntary facial tic and interpret its significance.

Are there moments of incongruence between facial expression and vocal tone?

When does the person’s face “freeze” — i.e., hold still unnaturally — and what triggers that?

What subtle expression signals discomfort before any verbal cue?

How does lighting or camera angle amplify or mute visible emotions?

III. Speech, Voice & Timing (10)

Describe baseline vocal timbre — breathy, clipped, resonant — and what personality trait it implies.

At which timestamp does pitch spike or flatten dramatically? Why?

How does speaking rate change when emotionally charged content arises?

Identify one pause longer than 1.5 seconds and interpret it psychologically.

What filler words or vocal tics recur, and what function do they serve?

How synchronized are gestures with speech rhythm?

Does the voice carry underlying fatigue, tension, or confidence? Provide audible markers.

Compare early vs. late segments: does articulation become more or less precise?

What is the emotional contour of the voice across the clip (anxious → calm, etc.)?

When does volume drop below baseline, and what coincides with it visually?

IV. Context, Environment & Interaction (10)

What environmental cues (background noise, lighting shifts) change mid-video?

How does the camera distance or angle influence perceived dominance or submission?

Are there off-screen sounds or glances suggesting another presence?

When the person looks away, where do they look, and what might they be avoiding?

How do objects in the frame get used or ignored (cup, pen, phone)?

Does the person adapt posture or tone in response to environmental change (light flicker, sound)?

What part of the environment most reflects personality (book titles, wall art, tidiness)?

How does background color palette influence mood perception?

Is there evidence of editing cuts or jump transitions that alter authenticity?

What temporal pacing (camera motion, cut frequency) matches or mismatches the emotional tempo?

V. Personality & Psychological Inference (10)

Based on kinetic patterns, what baseline temperament (introvert/extrovert, restrained/expressive) emerges?

What defense mechanism manifests dynamically (e.g., laughter after stress cue)?

When does self-presentation collapse momentarily into candor?

What behavioral marker suggests anxiety management (fidgeting, throat clearing, leg bounce)?

How does the person handle silence — restless, composed, avoidant?

Identify one moment that feels genuinely unguarded; what detail proves it?

What relational stance is enacted toward the viewer (teacher, confessor, performer)?

Does the body ever contradict the words? Provide timestamps.

What sustained pattern (voice-tone loop, repeated motion) indicates underlying psychological theme?

What overall transformation occurs from first to last frame — and what emotional or existential story does that evolution tell?
