30 Structured Psychoanalytic Questions for IMAGE-ONLY (PHOTO) INPUT
I. Raw Observation (No Interpretation Yet)

What is the person’s facial expression (neutral, strained smile, genuine smile, tense, withdrawn, etc.)?

What are the eyebrows doing (raised, furrowed, asymmetrical)?

What is the direction of gaze (direct eye contact, downward, sideways, unfocused)?

What is the state of the eyes (wide, narrowed, tired, guarded, glossy, dry)?

What is the mouth doing (pressed lips, open, smiling fully, smiling only with lips, slightly open)?

Is the jaw relaxed or tense?

Is the head tilted? If so: toward or away from camera/person?

What is the posture (upright, slouched, defensive, open, rigid)?

Are the shoulders raised, dropped, or tensed?

What are the hands doing (visible tension, gripping, hidden, open, fidgeting)?

What is the distance from the camera—close (intrusive) or distant (withdrawn)?

Is the photo posed or candid? How do you know?

What clothing is worn (formal, casual, highly styled, revealing, defensive layering)?

What colors dominate (dark, muted, vivid, chaotic, minimalist)?

Does the setting look controlled (studio, staged) or personal and unstaged (bedroom, messy room, car, etc.)?

II. Emotional Microstructure (Still No Interpretation of Personality)

What primary emotion appears present (calm, anxious, angry, sad, amused, detached)?

What secondary/subtle emotion appears present (embarrassment, defiance, contempt, fear, longing)?

Are the displayed emotions congruent (face, posture, setting align) or incongruent (smile but clenched jaw, relaxed pose but tense eyes)?

Is there evidence of masking or suppression of emotion (fake smile, controlled expression)?

Is the person inviting connection or establishing distance (based on eye contact, posture, framing)?

III. Relational / Object Relations Cues

Does this person appear to want to be perceived as strong, harmless, desirable, superior, invisible, etc.?

Is the body/face protecting anything (crossed arms, turned away torso, hidden hands)?

Does the person relate to the camera as a friend, intruder, audience, or threat?

Is there implicit submission or dominance in the pose?

Does the person seem to be performing a role? If so: what role (professional, seductive, intellectual, rebel, martyr, etc.)?

IV. Symbolic / Psychoanalytic Material

What objects in the background signal values, identity, or defenses (books, emptiness, luxury branding, religious symbols, chaos)?

Is there evidence of self-curation or control (filters, symmetry, perfect staging)?

Is there evidence of self-exposure or vulnerability (no makeup, messy setting, unposed)?

Does the image suggest avoidance (distance, obscured face, shadow, turned body) or demand for attention (close-up, piercing eye contact)?

If this image were a dream still-frame, what unconscious wish or fear might it be expressing?

How This Will Work in the App

The app sends the image + these 30 specific questions.

The LLM must answer them one-by-one with observable evidence first → micro-emotions → psychodynamics.

Only after answering all 30, it can then generate a short psychological profile like:

Core defense mechanisms

Attachment pattern

Narcissistic/self-effacing tendencies

Anxiety strategies (avoidant/hypervigilant/etc.)

Relation to others/self/world
