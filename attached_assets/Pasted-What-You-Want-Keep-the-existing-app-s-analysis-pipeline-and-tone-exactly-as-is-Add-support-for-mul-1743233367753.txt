What You Want:
Keep the existing app's analysis pipeline and tone exactly as is

Add support for multi-person analysis in:

‚úÖ Photos (still images)

‚úÖ Short videos (same format currently supported)

Cap the number of people to something reasonable (e.g., 5)

Don‚Äôt change anything else about how the analysis is written or interpreted‚Äîjust scale it to more people per file

üß† What Replit Needs to Be Told (Plain English)
Build an app that:

Accepts a photo or short video upload

Detects all visible people (up to 5)

For each person:

Isolates their face, pose, and speech (if available)

Runs the existing analysis logic (the one already in this app)

Outputs a separate analysis for each individual

Keeps the exact same personality analysis style, structure, and insight depth currently being used

Clearly labels each profile (e.g., ‚ÄúPerson 1,‚Äù ‚ÄúPerson 2,‚Äù or with physical descriptors if available)

Combines all analyses into a single report for the user

üõ† What This Means Technically (For Replit)
1. Photos:
Use Azure Face API (or Google Vision Face Detection if previously used)

For each face:

Extract a crop/region if needed

Pass facial data to the existing LLM prompt engine unchanged

2. Videos:
Sample 1‚Äì3 key frames (or every N seconds)

Use face tracking or recognition per frame

Group frame data by face (Rekognition or OpenCV face_recognition library can track people across frames)

If audio is present, extract per-person audio if spatial data is available (otherwise default to face only)

3. LLM Call:
No change to the prompt logic

Just run the current get_personality_analysis(data) function once per person

üßæ Final Output:
A scrollable or downloadable report containing:

Person 1: [Analysis...]

Person 2: [Analysis...]

Etc.

Optionally, a group dynamic summary section (you can add this later)

‚úÖ What You Should Tell Replit (Copy/Paste-Friendly)
Here‚Äôs exactly what to say to Replit:

Build an upgraded version of my current personality analysis app that supports multiple people in a single photo or short video.

The core personality analysis logic, style, and prompt must remain exactly the same as in the current app‚Äîit is already excellent.

What you are adding is the ability to:

Detect and analyze up to 5 people in a single photo

Detect and analyze up to 5 people across a short video (either per-frame or per-speaker if possible)

For each detected individual:

Use the existing analysis process

Generate a separate personality profile

Clearly label each profile (e.g., ‚ÄúPerson 1‚Äù, ‚ÄúPerson 2‚Äù)

Combine all the outputs into a single report, preserving the exact format, depth, and insight of the existing personality evaluations.

Do not alter the LLM prompt or analysis structure.

Also: If person-level audio can‚Äôt be reliably separated in video, default to visual-only analysis for those individuals. That‚Äôs fine.
