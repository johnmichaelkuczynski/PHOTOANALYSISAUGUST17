EVERY SINGLE TEXT ANALYSIS SHOULD ANSWER THE FOLLOWING 100 QUESTIONS: 

I. Information Processing Style (10)

Is the reasoning linear, branching, or circular?

Does the writer generalize prematurely or hold data until patterns emerge?

Are claims proportioned to evidence?

Does the mind shown seem inductive (pattern-seeking) or deductive (rule-enforcing)?

Does the prose reveal curiosity, or intellectual fatigue?

When the text confronts complexity, does it simplify or engage it?

Are problems treated as puzzles to solve or evils to condemn?

Does the argument actually advance, or does it spin in circles?

Does the author handle abstraction cleanly, or get lost in vagueness?

Does reasoning depend on concrete evidence or empty jargon?

When the author defines something, is it sharp and economical or padded and evasive?

Does the text reveal mastery of the material, or merely second-hand familiarity?

Does the writer tolerate internal tension, or hide contradictions with style?

Does the closing section resolve something or merely stop?

IV. Psychological Profile in Style (10)

Is the style dry, combative, ingratiating, or sermonizing?

After reading, do we feel we’ve encountered a mind in motion or a mask of erudition?
